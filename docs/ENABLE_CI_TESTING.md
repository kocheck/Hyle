# Enable CI Testing with Branch Protection

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Navigate to Repository Settings
Go to: https://github.com/kocheck/Hyle/settings/branches

### 2. Add Branch Protection Rule

Click **"Add rule"**

#### Branch Name Pattern
```
main
```

#### Required Settings

✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- Search for and select these checks:
  - `Web Tests (Shard 1/3)`
  - `Web Tests (Shard 2/3)`
  - `Web Tests (Shard 3/3)`
  - `Electron Tests`

✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
- Ensures tests run against latest `main`

✅ **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**
- Prevents force-merges (even for admins)

#### Optional (Recommended)

✅ **Require linear history**
- Cleaner git history

✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**
- All PR comments must be resolved
