# Hyle: World given form

> **Hyle** (noun): *Matter; the fundamental substance of which everything is composed.*

Hyle is a lightweight, local-first desktop application for Dungeon Masters. It replaces the physical battlemap with a digital projector or screen share, allowing you to manage your campaign map on one screen while projecting a player-facing view on another.

**Philosophy:** Hyle is a generic "digital battlemat." It doesn't know about D&D 5e, Pathfinder, or HP. It just handles maps, tokens, and dynamic fog of war. It respects your data ownership (local files) and privacy.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dual-Window Architecture**:
  - **Architect View**: The DM's control center with files, tools, and hidden info.
  - **World View**: A clean, borderless window to drag onto a second monitor/projector. Updates instantly.
- **Accessible Theme System**:
  - **Light/Dark Mode**: System-aware with manual override (View → Theme menu).
  - **WCAG AA Compliant**: All text and UI meets accessibility contrast standards.
  - **Persistent Preferences**: Theme choice saved locally and restored on launch.
  - **No Flash**: FOUC prevention ensures smooth theme loading.
- **Local-First Asset Pipeline**:
  - Drag and drop any image (JPG, PNG) directly onto the canvas.
  - **Auto-Optimization**: Large maps are automatically resized and converted to high-performance WebP formats.
  - **Cropping UI**: Built-in tool to crop and zoom tokens before importing.
- **Drawing Tools**:
  - **Marker & Eraser**: Quick sketches and annotations with Shift-key axis locking for straight lines.
  - **Wall Tool**: Draw vision-blocking walls (invisible to players, dashed red in DM view).
- **Fog of War System**:
  - **Dynamic Vision**: PC tokens reveal areas based on configurable vision radius (darkvision support).
  - **Blurred Aesthetic**: Unseen areas are blurred and darkened rather than hidden by a solid black overlay, preserving context while obscuring details.
  - **Wall Occlusion**: Walls block line of sight using real-time raycasting algorithm.
  - **Token Inspector**: Edit token properties (name, type, vision radius) in DM view.
- **Persistence**: Save your entire session to a `.hyle` file (a compressed ZIP archive of your scene and assets) and load it back instantly.
- **Advanced Grid System**:
  - **Dynamic Snapping**: Tokens snap to grid intersections (2x2) or cell centers (1x1) automatically.
  - **Infinite Grid**: The grid extends infinitely and only renders what is visible.
  - **Visual Modes**: Toggle between Lines, Dots, or Hidden grid.
  - **Theme-Aware**: Grid colors adapt to light/dark mode automatically.
- **Smart Map Tools**:
  - **Auto-Center**: Camera automatically focuses on new maps.
  - **Center on Party**: One-click button to instantly frame all PC tokens in the view.
  - **Calibration**: Interactive "Draw to Calibrate" tool to perfectly align your map's grid.
  - **Viewport Constraints**: Prevents getting lost in the void by keeping the map in view.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `V`: Select Tool
  - `M`: Marker Tool
  - `E`: Eraser Tool
  - `W`: Wall Tool (vision blocking)
  - `I`: Color Picker
  - `Shift` (while drawing): Lock to horizontal/vertical axis

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- npm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hyle.git

# Install dependencies
cd hyle
npm install
```

### Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will launch the Electron application in development mode.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```
This will generate an installer/executable for your operating system in the `dist/` or `release/` folder.

## 🧪 Testing

Hyle has comprehensive E2E test coverage using Playwright (172 test cases, 4,600+ lines).

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium

# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:e2e:web          # Web tests only
npm run test:e2e:electron     # Electron tests only
npm run test:e2e:functional   # Functional tests only

# Interactive UI mode (recommended for development)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Debug mode (step through tests)
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Test Coverage

| Area | Test Cases | Coverage |

### CI/CD Setup

**Current Configuration:** Hybrid (Local + CI Safety Net)
- ✅ Tests run locally via pre-push hook (fast feedback)
- ✅ CI runs on `main` branch after merge (safety net)
- ✅ Low cost: ~180-900 GitHub Actions minutes/month

**Want different setup?**
- **Full CI with PR blocking**: See [`docs/ENABLE_CI_TESTING.md`](docs/ENABLE_CI_TESTING.md)
- **Local-only (zero CI cost)**: See [`docs/LOCAL_TESTING_WORKFLOW.md`](docs/LOCAL_TESTING_WORKFLOW.md)
- **Current hybrid approach**: See [`docs/HYBRID_TESTING_WORKFLOW.md`](docs/HYBRID_TESTING_WORKFLOW.md)

### For Contributors

**Before pushing code:**
```bash
# Tests run automatically via pre-push hook
git push
# → Tests execute → If pass, push succeeds
```

**To skip tests (emergency only):**
```bash
git push --no-verify
```
