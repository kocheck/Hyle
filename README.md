> **Graphium** (Latin, from Greek *grapheîon*): A Roman stylus; a pointed writing tool for incising letters into wax tablets.

**Graphium** is a digital tool for **Tactile Cartography**. We are moving away from "whiteboarding"—which feels slippery and temporary—to **Graphium**, which implies etching and permanence. When a Dungeon Master or Designer uses this app, they aren't just sketching; they are carving the unknown into existence.

**Pronunciation**: GRAF-ee-um
**Tagline**: "Inscribe the World."

## 🏛 Philosophy

**From passive "matter" to active "tool".**

Romans drafted notes, letters, and plans with a *graphium* on wax; finalized history in ink; and surveyed with instruments. We bring that etched decisiveness to the digital age.

Most digital canvases feel slippery and disposable. Graphium builds in controlled friction and "bite," so marks read as choices, not guesses. Edits are easy (as they were on wax), but every stroke carries intention.

Your ideas don't float; they stick. Pick up the tool. **Inscribe the world.**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**TL;DR**: Local-first virtual tabletop. No accounts, no cloud, no slippery whiteboards. Just you, the stylus, and the infinite canvas.

```bash
# Clone, install, and run
git clone https://github.com/kocheck/Graphium.git
cd Graphium
npm install
npm run dev
```

**First Session Setup:**
1. Launch Graphium.
2. Create or load a campaign.
3. Drag a map image onto the surface.
4. Click "World View" to open the player display.
5. Inscribe tokens and etch fog of war.
6. Save your session (`.graphium` file).

## ⚔️ The Tools of Interaction

### **The Stylus (Marker Tools)**
- **Etch**: Annotate the map with decisive lines.
- **Inscribe**: Place tokens and markers that feel weighted and permanent.
- **Surface**: The infinite canvas that accepts your inscription.

### **Dual-Window Architecture**
- **Architect View**: Your workshop. Tools, files, and hidden knowledge.
- **World View**: The projection. A pristine view for your players, revealing only what you choose to show.

### **The Wax Tablet (Persistence)**
- **`.graphium` Files**: Your campaigns are stored in compressed archives.
- **Local Sovereignty**: No cloud wizard touches your data. It stays on your machine, etched into your drive.

### **Fog of War**
- **Incision**: Cut through the darkness. Tokens reveal what they see.
- **Occlusion**: Walls block sight, creating mystery and tactical depth.
