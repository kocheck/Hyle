### *An Arcane Battlemat for the Discerning Dungeon Master*

---

> **Hyle** (noun, from ancient Greek *ὕλη*): *Matter; the fundamental substance of which everything is composed. The raw material from which worlds are forged.*

Greetings, Master of Dungeons! You hold in your hands the chronicle of **Hyle**, a lightweight, local-first desktop grimoire designed to replace your physical battlemap with the power of digital sorcery. Project your campaign map onto a second monitor or screen share, maintaining total control over what your players see while you orchestrate the chaos from your Architect's throne.

**The Sacred Philosophy:** Hyle is a **generic digital battlemat**—no more, no less. It cares not whether you run D&D 5e, Pathfinder, or a homebrew system powered by coin flips and interpretive dance. It handles **maps, tokens, and dynamic fog of war** without demanding tribute to corporate overlords. Your data remains **yours**, stored locally in sacred `.hyle` tomes that no cloud wizard can touch.

## ⚔️ **Arcane Capabilities**
### *The Powers at Your Command*

- **🏰 Dual-Window Enchantment**:
  - **Architect View**: Your command center. Files, tools, hidden knowledge—this is your war room.
  - **World View**: A pristine, borderless window for your players. Drag it to a projector or second display and watch their faces light up as the map materializes before them.

- **🌗 Accessible Theme Sorcery**:
  - **Light/Dark Mode**: Automatically detects your system preference, but you can override it with a flick of the View menu.
  - **WCAG AA Compliant**: Every piece of text meets accessibility standards—because even evil wizards need good contrast ratios.
  - **Persistent Preferences**: Your theme choice is etched into local storage and restored when you next summon the app.
  - **No Flash**: FOUC prevention ensures your theme loads smoothly, like a well-cast *Prestidigitation*.

- **🎨 Local-First Asset Conjuration**:
  - **Drag & Drop Magic**: Hurl any image (JPG, PNG) onto the canvas and watch it materialize.
  - **Auto-Optimization**: Large maps are automatically transmuted into high-performance WebP formats, compressed and optimized like a *Reduce* spell.
  - **Cropping Ritual**: Built-in UI to crop and zoom tokens before they join your campaign.

- **✏️ Drawing Tools of Power**:
  - **Marker & Eraser**: Sketch annotations and tactical notes. Hold Shift to lock your strokes to horizontal or vertical axes—perfect for drawing dungeon corridors.
  - **Wall Tool**: Draw vision-blocking barriers invisible to players but shown as dashed red lines in your DM view. They'll never see that ambush coming.

- **🌫️ Fog of War Manipulation**:
  - **Dynamic Vision**: PC tokens reveal areas based on configurable vision radius. Darkvision? Torchlight? You control it all.
  - **Blurred Aesthetic**: Instead of solid black occlusion, unseen areas are blurred and darkened—preserving context while obscuring details.
  - **Wall Occlusion**: Walls block line of sight using a real-time raycasting algorithm. It's geometry, but cooler.
  - **Token Inspector**: Edit token properties (name, type, vision radius) directly in the DM view.

- **💾 Persistence Enchantment**:
  - Save your entire session to a **`.hyle` file** (a compressed ZIP archive containing your scene and assets). Load it back instantly during your next session. No spell slots required.

- **📐 Advanced Grid Matrix**:
  - **Dynamic Snapping**: Tokens snap to grid intersections (for Large 2×2 creatures) or cell centers (for Medium 1×1 heroes).
  - **Infinite Grid**: The grid stretches to the horizon and only renders what's visible—because rendering infinity is bad for frame rates.
  - **Visual Modes**: Toggle between Lines, Dots, or Hidden grid styles.
  - **Theme-Aware**: Grid colors automatically adapt to light/dark mode.

- **🗺️ Smart Map Manipulation**:
  - **Auto-Center**: Camera automatically focuses on newly loaded maps.
  - **Center on Party**: One-click button to frame all PC tokens in view. Never lose your party again (at least not on the map).
  - **Calibration Rite**: Interactive "Draw to Calibrate" tool to align your map's grid with pixel-perfect precision.
  - **Viewport Constraints**: Prevents the camera from drifting into the Astral Plane (the void outside your map).

- **⌨️ Incantations (Keyboard Shortcuts)**:
  - `V`: Select Tool
  - `M`: Marker Tool
  - `E`: Eraser Tool
  - `W`: Wall Tool (vision blocking)
  - `I`: Color Picker
  - `Shift` (while drawing): Lock axis (horizontal/vertical only)

## 🔮 **The Summoning Ritual**
### *Installation and Invocation*

### **Prerequisites (Reagents Required)**
Before you begin the ritual, ensure you have gathered:
- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)—the primordial runtime
- **npm**—the package manager of the ancients

### **Step 1: Cloning the Grimoire**

Open your terminal (also known as your "scrying window") and speak these words:

```bash
# Clone the repository from the astral archives
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hyle.git

# Enter the sacred directory
cd hyle

# Invoke the dependency installation incantation
npm install
```

### **Step 2: Awakening the Application (Development Mode)**

To summon Hyle in its raw, untamed form:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This launches the Electron application in **development mode**. The app will manifest before you, ready to serve.

### **Step 3: Forging the Final Artifact (Production Build)**

When you're ready to create a standalone executable for distribution to your fellow DMs:

```bash
npm run build
```

This ritual will generate an installer or executable for your operating system, deposited into the `dist/` or `release/` folder. Distribute it to your party members and let them marvel at your generosity.

## 🧪 **Trial by Combat (Testing)**
### *Proving Your Code's Mettle*

Hyle doesn't just *work*—it has been **battle-tested** with comprehensive end-to-end coverage using **Playwright**. We're talking **172 test cases** spanning **4,600+ lines** of tactical assertions.

### **Quick Start: Running the Trials**

```bash
# First time only: Install Playwright's chromium browser
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium

# Run all tests (full campaign)
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test suites (pick your battleground)
npm run test:e2e:web          # Web tests only
npm run test:e2e:electron     # Electron tests only
npm run test:e2e:functional   # Functional tests only

# Interactive UI mode (recommended for debugging)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Debug mode (step through tests like a careful rogue)
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### **Coverage Report (Kill Count)**

| Area | Test Cases | Coverage |

**Total Test Cases**: 172
**Total Coverage**: 💯 **Critical Hit!**

### **CI/CD Garrison (Continuous Defense)**

**Current Configuration:** Hybrid (Local + CI Safety Net)
- ✅ Tests run locally via **pre-push hook** (fast feedback before you commit to the charge)
- ✅ CI runs on `main` branch after merge (safety net for catastrophic failures)
- ✅ **Low cost**: ~180-900 GitHub Actions minutes/month (cheaper than hiring a familiar)

**Want a different battle strategy?**
- **Full CI with PR blocking**: See [`docs/ENABLE_CI_TESTING.md`](docs/ENABLE_CI_TESTING.md)
- **Local-only (zero CI cost)**: See [`docs/LOCAL_TESTING_WORKFLOW.md`](docs/LOCAL_TESTING_WORKFLOW.md)
- **Current hybrid approach**: See [`docs/HYBRID_TESTING_WORKFLOW.md`](docs/HYBRID_TESTING_WORKFLOW.md)

### **For Contributors (Joining the Party)**

**Before pushing code:**
```bash
# Tests run automatically via pre-push hook
git push
# → Tests execute → If they pass, your push succeeds
```

**To skip tests (emergency extraction only):**
```bash
git push --no-verify  # Use sparingly—like a Wish spell
```

## 🗡️ **Wielding the Map of Worlds**
### *Basic Usage Guide*

### **1. Launch the Application**
Speak the incantation:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### **2. Project the World View**
Click the **"World View"** button to summon the second window. Drag it to your projector or second monitor. This is what your players will see—keep it clean, keep it mysterious.

### **3. Build Your Battlefield**
- **Add Maps**: Drag map images (JPG, PNG) directly onto the canvas. Watch them snap into place.
- **Add Tokens**: Drag token images onto the canvas. A cropping UI will appear—adjust the frame, then confirm.
- **Draw Annotations**: Select the **Marker** tool (press `M`) to sketch terrain features, tactical notes, or rude drawings of the BBEG.
- **Set Up Walls**: Use the **Wall** tool (press `W`) to draw vision-blocking barriers. Players won't see them, but their tokens' vision will respect them.

### **4. Save Your Session**
